## Project Overview

This project includes data from [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home) for data relating from deforestation between the years 1990 to 2016. It is included as part of Udacity's SQL Nanodegree Program. 


## Project Breakdown

The files for this project are broken into two major sections.
1. Queries.sql: Full .sql notebook used for querying
2. Deforestation Exploration.pdf: PDF summary of exploration as required in project brief

The Deforestation Exploration.pdf has these major headings to follow:

        |-- Global Situation
        |-- Regional Outlook
        |-- Country-Level Detail
        |-- Recommendations
        |-- Appendix: SQL queries used

## Extra

Both the `queries.sql` and the `DeforestationExploration.pdf` have the project questions right before the query used to answer them. Reading through the `queries.sql` file would give a good foundation to understand the project structure.
